Arduino debugger
================

This is a console debugger for use with sketches running on an embedded Arduino system.
After uploading your sketch to the Arduino, you can connect the serial port to your
computer and debug your running sketch with this application.

You must include a small debugging library (`dbg.cpp` and `PyArduinoDebug.h`) available at
https://github.com/kimballa/PyArduinoDebug in your application. 

* Arduino IDE users can include the `PyArduinoDebug` library in their sketch dependencies.
* If compiling with a Makefile, you should `#include <PyArduinoDebug.h>` and link with
  `libPyArduinoDebug.a` to enable debugging your sketch.

You will find instructions in `PyArduinoDebug.h` on the API for creating unconditional
and assertion-based breakpoints, and emitting debug and trace messages.

Setup
-----

* Install this debugger and its dependencies with `pip install arduino-dbg` or if you
  have checked out the source on github with: `pip install .`
* If not already installed, install `binutils` through your OS package manager (`apt`, `yum`, ...).
* Add the `PyArduinoDebug` library to your project in the Arduino IDE, or clone and
  build the [Arduino library](https://github.com/kimballa/PyArduinoDebug) with
  `make install`.
* Follow instructions in `PyArduinoDebug.h` to include in your application.
* Run `arduino-dbg` to launch the debug console. Use `-h` to see CLI options.
* Set your Arduino platform: e.g.: `set arduino.platform = uno`
* Use the `help` command at the prompt to see available capabilities.

Usage
-----

Typical usage is something like:

```
arduino-dbg -f /path/to/sketch.elf -p /dev/ttyACM0
```

(Assuming your Arduino's USB serial port connection is on `ttyACM0`.)

If you run the `break` command or press `^C` within the debugger, it will pause the
running sketch so you can interrogate or set the values of variables (`print someglobal`),
see a `backtrace`, etc. Programmatic breakpoints can be selectively toggled on and off
with `breakpoint enable` and `breakpoint disable`. New breakpoints can be created from
the debugger at runtime only on platforms like the ARM Cortex-M4 which support
monitor-mode debugging. On AVR CPUs, you are restricted to breakpoints added statically
in the source code.

Within the debugger, you can save a dump of the system registers and memory with `dump
<filename>`. With this dump file and the compiled ELF file of your sketch, you can then
perform offline debugging later with `arduino-dbg -d /path/to/filename.dump`, or by
running `load /path/to/filename.dump` within the debugger.

The dump file will retain the filename of your sketch's ELF file. If you move it to a
different location, you can open the ELF file with `open /path/to/my.elf` within the
debugger after running the `load` command.

There are several additional commands. Typing `help` will list available commands in the
debugger. Type `help <command>` to see usage information for each specific command.

Type `quit`, `exit`, or `\q` to quit the debugger.

Arduino platforms
-----------------

You should specify what Arduino platform you are using with the `set` command. e.g.:

```
set arduino.platform = uno
```

The available platforms are:

* `feather_m4`
* `leonardo`
* `uno`

You can see an up-to-date list of supported Arduino platforms with the `list platforms`
command. The `list architectures` command will display supported CPU architectures.

By default the platform is `auto`, and the debugger will attempt to auto-detect your CPU.
You can force auto-detection with:

```
set arduino.platform = auto
```

Please open an issue if you are interested in support for additional platforms. At the
time of this writing, the debugger has the ability to support AVR- and ARM-based
platforms; each new cpu or platform in these families just requires a new configuration file
to be added and tested.

Type `set` to see more configuration variables you can modify. Once set, configuration is
saved to `~/.arduino_dbg.conf` and reused in future sessions. You can delete this file and
restart the debugger to reinitialize the default configuration.

CPU-assisted debugger support
-----------------------------

This debugger can perform useful functions on any Arduino with a USB-serial connection.
The debugger service can be activated by breakpoints introduced with the `BREAK()` macro
or by issuing the `break` (`^C`) command within the debugger prompt.

Beyond that, for CPUs that support "monitor-mode debugging" (where debug events trigger an
IRQ which can be handled with onboard software, rather than requiring control by an
external JTAG debugger), such as the ARM SAMD51-based Cortex-M4, used in the Adafruit
Feather-M4 platform, this debugger can also take advantage of CPU-assisted debugging
features such as single-stepping with the `step` (`\s`) command, or using the ability to
create new breakpoints or watchpoints dynamically at run-time.

On such platforms, the ARM `BKPT` opcode will also properly enter the debugger service.
